# Petfinder Data Analysis Project (On going)
This repository contains my on-going project where I pull and process data from Petfinder API to analyze the time listed till adoption for cats based on their characteristics.

I was inspired to start this project after trying to find information about my 7-year-old cat, Jazzy, since the adoption center could not provide much detail about her background.

## Data Collection
The data is collected from the Petfinder API and processed to clean and format (from JSON) the data for analysis. The data includes information about cats such as breed, age, gender, and more.

## Analysis
The project is currently in development and the goal is to analyze the time listed till adoption for cats based on their characteristics. The analysis will be done in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Structure
The directory contains two Jupyter Notebooks:
Petfinder_Data_Collection.ipynb - This notebook contains the code for pulling and cleaning data from the Petfinder API.
Petfinder_Data_Analysis.ipynb - This notebook is still in development and will contain the code for analyzing the data.

Dependencies
The following packages were used for this project:

- petpy
- pandas
- numpy
- plotly

Conclusion
This project aims to use data analysis to better understand the time listed till adoption for cats based on their characteristics. The project is ongoing and updates will be made as the analysis progresses.
